    <h1>Frieren: Beyond journey's End's first episode highlights the value of a relations and the regrets of taking time for granted. A strong first episode earned the show various types of viewers and best anime in history in many spheres. Here is why</h1>
    <p>Instead of following the typical fantasy story, the story takes place after the heroes take down the greatest threat of the world. Frieren, the mage of the group of heroes, is an elf, who had lived for many centuries at this point. While decades passed for the others in her party who have shorter life spans, Frieren experience only a fraction of time. This disconnect becomes aparent when one of her party members, Himmel the Hero, passes away who deemed Frieren a good friend and more. However, Frieren realizes how little time she spent with Himmel and how late she valued her relationship. Frieren tells a beautiful story to allow you to intake the emotions the show wants to display. With the great animation for you to immersive yourself into the world, Frieren is an overall great anime to recommend to anyone</p> 
    <h2>The first episode sets the perfect tone of the story, and entraps viewers to an episode worth its own movie. Because of these facts, I give the first episode of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End a 5/5<h2></h2>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)</p>
